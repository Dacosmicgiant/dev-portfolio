RESUME SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

To set up your resume download:

1. Add your resume PDF file to this public directory
2. Name it 'resume.pdf' 
3. Or update the resumeUrl path in src/data/portfolio.ts to match your file name

The current configuration expects the file to be at:
/resume.pdf

This will make it accessible at:
https://yourdomain.com/resume.pdf

Make sure your resume file is optimized and includes:
- Contact information
- Professional experience  
- Skills and technologies
- Education
- Projects (optional, since they're showcased on the site)
